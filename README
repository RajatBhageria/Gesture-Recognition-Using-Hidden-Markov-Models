There are 5 main files
* preprocessTrainingData.py
* HMM.py
* trainGestureModel.py
* predictTestGesture.py

preprocessTrainingData is used to run k-means and descretize the data and then convert it into 6 matrices (one for each
kind of gesture), and each matrix has multiple sequences of observations associated with that gesture. This file then saves
these arrays as beat3Obs.pickle, beat4Obs.pickle, and etc for the rest of the files.

HMM has three main functions, one that does log forward, one that does log backward, and one that does baum-walch.

trainGestureModel reads in the different pickle files with the observation sequences that prepreocessTrainingData generated,
creates a HMM for each of the 6 gestures, and then runs baum-walch for each of the 6 gestures on the training data,
and then it saves the trained models as a pickle file "HMMModels.picke"

predictTestGesture takes in a filename of the test sequence, loads the 6 HMM models for each of the gestures, and then
runs the forward algorithm on the sequence on each of the models and then returns the name of the gesture that has
the highest probaility.

In order to test, open classifyTestData and edit the fileName where the data is stored and then press run.
