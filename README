preprocessTrainingData is used to run k-means and descretize the data and then convert it into 6 matrices (one for each
kind of gesture), and each matrix has multiple sequences of observations associated with that gesture.

In order to test, open classifyTestData and edit the fileName where the data is stored and then press run.
